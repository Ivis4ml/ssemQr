## Introduction

`ssemQr` is a package that ultilizes the Proximal Alternating Linearized Maximal to solve the
non-convex non-smooth sparse structrual equation model for identification trans-eQTLs via joint eQTL mapping and
inferring Gene Regulatory Network(GRN).

## Installation

To install `ssemQr`, you need a C++ compiler such as `g++` or `clang++` with C++11 feature,
and for Windows users, the [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/index.html)
software is needed (unless you can configure the toolchain by yourself).

The installation follows the typical way of R packages on Github:

  ```r
library(devtools)
install_github("Ivis4ml/ssemQr")
```

`ssemQr` package will be uploaded on CRAN later. Then you can install it via CRAN

```r
install.packages("ssemQr")
```
